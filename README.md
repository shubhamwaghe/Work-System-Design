### Questions
##### Question 1 
#
> The Dorben company wishes to measure the percentage of machine downtime in the lathe department. An original estimate showed the downtime to be approximately p = 0.20. The desired results were to be within +(/-) 5% of p, with a confidence level of 0.95. Analyst can take 400 readings a day.
(a) How many days will the sampling experiment be initially planned for?
(b) Simulate the experiment using a p-chart (with +/- 3-Sigma control limits) and report the revised estimate of p and achieved accuracy.

##### Question 2
#
> Given the attached data on bigram probability and movement times, use the Simulated Annealing algorithm to find out a best feasible solution for letter assignment (26 letters) for the trapezoid layout. You are free to choose the parameters after sufficient tuning.
